        The COVID-19 pandemic has put French hospital systems under immense strain. 
        
        **But has this impact been uniform across the country? How has it evolved over the course of the waves?**

        From the first sudden surge in spring 2020 to the later waves driven by new variants, hospitals faced unprecedented challenges‚Äîovercrowded ICUs, exhausted medical staff, 
        and regional disparities in resources.

        - Compare national trajectories with regional variations in hospitalization, death, and critical care rates.
        - Explore epidemic waves, identify underlying factors, and support public health policy decisions.

        #### Why This Matters
        COVID-19 reshaped healthcare systems across France. Regional hospitalization patterns reveal where resources were most strained ‚Äî and where resilience emerged.

        #### Data Context
        This dashboard uses official French regional data (2020‚Äì2023):
        - Hospitalization rates (`tx_indic_7J_hosp`)
        - Critical care rates (`tx_indic_7J_SC`)
        - Death rates (`tx_indic_7J_DC`)
